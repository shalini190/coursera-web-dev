                        The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red
                        junglefowl (Gallus gallus). They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
                        with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[1], up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2]
                        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep
                        chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly,
                        as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept
                        for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).
                        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
                        East Asia,[5] but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa
                        originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to
                        Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in
                        Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to
                        Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
                        III.
                        In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as
                        cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly
                        called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.[10] Castrated roosters are called
                        capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females
                        over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[11] although in the
                        egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of
                        age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook
                        /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[12] The young are often called chicks.

                        "Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.[13] The species as a whole was then called
                        domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens",
                        sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and
                        many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).

                        In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term
                        yardbird.
                        Chickens are omnivores.[15] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds,
                        insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[16] or young mice.[17]

                        The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[18] The world's
                        oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to
                        the Guinness World Records.[19]

                        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails
                        and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of
                        brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such
                        as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as
                        the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the
                        development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and
                        female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their
                        heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks
                        called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are
                        called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds
                        these are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds
                        which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.
                        Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter chickens are
                        generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they
                        would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but
                        generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
                        Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                        incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,
                        establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and
                        nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this
                        social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to
                        an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[20] When a rooster finds food, he may call
                        other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and
                        dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and
                        encourage them to eat.

                        A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
                        roosters.[21] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their
                        surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens
                        also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the
                        ground.
                        Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then
                        incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to "go broody". The broody hen will stop laying and
                        instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She
                        will "sit" or "set" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and
                        she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains
                        the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during
                        the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial
                        eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire
                        floor.

                        in the adult Chelonian. bo = Basi-occipital, bt = Basi-temporal, eo = Opisthotic, f = Frontal,
                        fm = Foramen magnum, fo = Fontanella, oc = Occipital condyle, op = Opisthotic, p = Parietal, pf
                        = Post-frontal, sc = Sinus canal in supra-occipital, so = Supra-occpital, sq = Squamosal, 8 =
                        Exit of vagus nerve.
                        Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and those that do often stop
                        part-way through the incubation. However, other breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie,
                        do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for
                        those of other species — even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation
                        periods, such as quail, pheasants, turkeys, or geese.
